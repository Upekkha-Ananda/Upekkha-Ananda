- 👋 Hi, I’m @Upekkha-Ananda
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding, security, programming, full stack, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML. HTML5, CSS and applied accessability. I am also studying to take the notary exam.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that aids with learning how to use all this in real world simulations and situations.
- 📫 How to reach me. Please contact me at jenevans459@gmail.com. Jennifer Evans is my legal name and Upekkha Ananda is my Yogini name, which I prefer to use.
